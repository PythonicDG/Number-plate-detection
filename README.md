# Number-plate-detection
The project focuses on developing a Python-based system for license plate detection within images. 
Leveraging OpenCV for image processing and pytesseract for optical character recognition (OCR), the system identifies and extracts license plate information from images.

This project aims to provide a foundation for automating the extraction of license plate information from images using Python and computer vision techniques.
